# Twitter System Design

Functional requirements :

1. User should be able to tweet
2. User should be able to follow another user
3. User should be able to see their home timeline (the main page)
4. User should be able to see their user timeline (their own tweets)

Non functional requirements :

1. Twitter is read heavy system, most users are mostly reading the tweets rather than writing a tweet
2. The system should be highly available
3. The system should have very low latency
